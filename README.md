# Object-Detection
Developed a real-time accident detection system using YOLO and Python to identify collisions from live video feeds. Integrate YOLO for object detection. Upon detecting an accident, the system triggers an alarm or sends alerts to emergency contacts, enabling quick response. Optimized for smart surveillance and traffic monitoring.
